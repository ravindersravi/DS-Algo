Q : A college organized various training programs for students. Each program has the following fields ,
 [Program  name][Start Time][End Time] [program Value]. These details were stored in a vector of string.

Find out how many program a students attends to maximize his/her total program value.

4 -> Number of Program scheduled in a day;

[P1] [14][15][200] // 14 implies 1400 or 2pm;
[p2][18][19][200]  //200
[p3][16][19][100]  // 300
[p4][15][18][100]    //300
Output:
3
(P1->P4->P2)
This question can be solved by using greedy approach . Only 3-4 students could solve it completely from 90 students.
 Around 30 students were shortlisted for the next round
